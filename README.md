# Local Admin Janitor
This tool will scan hosts in a specified Active Directory OU, retrieve all local administrator memberships, then create the GPO migration files necessary to apply and enforce local admin memberships to all of the specified hosts.
## Background
In many organizations local administrator rights are not enforced via GPO but rather the GPO-specified local administrative users are additive, so naturally we end up with rights creep that we need to regain control of.  This tool collects the local admininstrative users for all online computers within a specified Active Directory OU/CN.  This information is then processed to create hosts groups with common assigned local administrator rights, and finally outputting [GPO Migration table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/gpmc/using-migration-tables) files that can be used to apply and enforce these rights on specified hosts.
